    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p>Last updated: March 12, 2024</p>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>This Privacy Policy describes how Retro Clock Screensaver ("we", "our", or "app") handles your information.</p>

    <h2>Information Collection</h2>
    <p>Our app does not collect, store, or transmit any personal information. The app functions entirely offline as a screensaver/clock display and does not require any personal data to operate.</p>

    <h2>App Permissions</h2>
    <p>The app only requires basic system permissions to function as a screensaver. These include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Display over other apps (for screensaver functionality)</li>
        <li>Run at startup (optional, for screensaver activation)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Data Storage</h2>
    <p>The app only stores your display preferences (such as color settings) locally on your device. This information never leaves your device and is only used to remember your preferred display settings.</p>

    <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>We do not use any third-party services or analytics tools in our app.</p>

    <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page.</p>

    <h2>Contact Us</h2>
    <p>If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, please contact us at: [Your Email Address]</p>
